            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there, I'm Gabriel, a 23-year-old Brazilian with a real passion for all things tech and racing. I spent my formative years soaking up the vibrant culture of Brazil until I was 16, which instilled in me a unique blend of tradition and modernity.</p>

            <p>Now, I call Belgium home, and I've been on quite an adventure. I've spent the last two years working as a programmer, diving deep into the ever-evolving world of technology. I absolutely love coding and the thrill of problem-solving; it's like a puzzle I can't resist. And guess what? I'm excited to bring my skills and expertise to a new company, ready to take on fresh challenges and learn even more.</p>
            
            <p>But there's more to me than just lines of code. My heart races for another kind of thrill â€“ motorsports. Whether I'm glued to the TV, watching Formula 1 races, or out on the track for some karting action, I find sheer joy and excitement in the world of racing.</p>
            
            <p>In both my professional and personal life, I'm all about embracing adventure, staying curious, and welcoming change with open arms. I'm looking forward to making new connections, exploring new horizons, and continuing this incredible journey with a big smile on my face. Cheers to new beginnings!</p>
